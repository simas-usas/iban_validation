# iban_validation
This app quickly checks whether an IBAN code is valid or not.<br/>
I set up the project using knowledge I attained from Sourcery Academy. For the IBAN validation , I looked for guides online in order to avoid any pitfalls within the functionality.<br/>

## Quick start
To set up the project, open up a terminal in the ```app``` folder. First of all, you have to install all the necessary modules. This can be achieved with this command: 

```npm i```

Once installed, type in this command:

```npm run start```

Then open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to see your app.
